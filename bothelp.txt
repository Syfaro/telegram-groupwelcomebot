*Help for GroupWelcomeBot*

Basic commands:
/start - initializes the bot for this channel
/enable - starts sending messages to this channel
/disable - stops sending messages to this channel
/set - sets a config value for your channel
/setrules - set rules text to send to users when they do /rules
/rules - show channel rules

Set commands:
There are a few different values you can set.
All messages related to a user joining (new, left) will replace USER\_NAME with the user's actual name. Additionally, RULES\_LINK will be replaced with a link to your rules.

new - _message sent when a new user joins the channel_
left - _message sent when a user leaves or is kicked from the channel_

For example, to make it say "Hi Syfaro! Please read our rules: google.com" when someone joins, you can run the following command:
/set new Hi USER\_NAME! Please read our rules: RULES\_LINK
